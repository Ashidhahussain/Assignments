	<p>A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow generalized sequences of operations, called programs, enable them to perform a wide range of tasks.</p>
	<h4><a id="CPU">CPU</a></h4>
	<p>A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.</p>
	<h4><a id="Alu"></a>ALU</h4>
	<p>In computing, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU is a basic building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer, even the simplest microcontrollers contain one for purposes such as timing.</p>
	<h2><a id="PL">PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</a></h2>

	<h4><a id="C">C</a></h4>
	<p> The C programming language is a computer programming language that was developed to do system programming for the operating system UNIX and is an imperative programming language. C was developed in the early 1970 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. ... C is a compiled language.</p>
	<h4><a id="C++">C<sup>++</sup></a></h4>
	<p>C++ destructors for local variables are called at the end of the object lifetime, allowing a discipline for automatic resource management termed RAII, which is widely used in C++. Member variables are created when the parent object is created.</p>

	<h4><a id="RDBMS">RDBMS</a></h4>
	<p>A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as invented by Edgar F.Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory.</p>
	<h4><a id="OODBMS">OODBMS</a></h4>
	<p>An object database (also object-oriented database management system, OODBMS) is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming. ... Object-relational databases are a hybrid of both approaches.</p>
	<h4><a id="HDBMS">HDBM</a></h4>
	<p> A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. The data is stored as records which are connected to one another through links.</p>
	<h4><a id="NWBMS">NWDBMS</a></h4>
	<p>The network model is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships. Its distinguishing feature is that the schema, viewed as a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types are arcs, is not restricted to being a hierarchy or lattice.</p>
